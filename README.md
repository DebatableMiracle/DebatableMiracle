## Some fun things I made 🚀
### 🔹 [Glance: AI-Powered Screen Assistant](https://github.com/anubhavverma/glance)
A **Google Lens-inspired AI assistant application for PC**, using multimodal AI models to analyze and interact with the screen in real-time.

### 🔹 ESP32-Based CSI Heart Rate Monitor
A research-driven **WiFi Channel State Information-based non-contact heart rate monitor**.

### 🔹[Parrot-TTS](https://github.com/DebatableMiracle/Parrot-Text-To-Speech.git)
A Voice cloning Text to speech with emotional and accent control using OpenVoice models with models.

### 🔹[Ghost Agent (beta)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=debatableMiracle.ghost-agent-beta)
An Agentic AI based VS code extension which uses Gemini (working on claude integration) to read/write/run/observe your Jupyter Notebooks. The agent can do task in multiple steps to acheive results (given the prompt is clear lol) looping multiple times in the notebook via a Think Act Observe loop. Check the beta out and give your bugs and I'll fix it!

Also check out my [hugging face](https://huggingface.co/honestlyanubhav) for more of my deployed projects such as my sample [Agent named Alfred](https://huggingface.co/spaces/honestlyanubhav/AlfredAgent) which uses a internet search tool to give you the best and updated results or the [semantic book recommender](https://huggingface.co/spaces/honestlyanubhav/bookworm-v1-book-recommender) which recommends books based on the query and your mood!
